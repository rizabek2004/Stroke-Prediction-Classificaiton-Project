# Stroke-Prediction-Classificaiton-Project
The stroke prediction in this project is made on highly imbalanced data. To handle this problem, I used SMOTE technique, which synthesizes new data for minority class (stroke positive class). 
Different classification models are used and compared using the f1-score, confusion matrix, and ROC-AUC-curve metrics.

The data was obtained from the Kaggle website.
