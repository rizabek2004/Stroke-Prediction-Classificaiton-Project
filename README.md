# Stroke-Prediction-Classificaiton-Project
The stroke prediction in this project is made on highly imbalanced data. To handle this problem, I used SMOTE technique, which synthesizes new data for minority class (stroke positive class). 

Different classification models are used and compared using the f1-score, confusion matrix, and ROC-AUC-curve metrics. It was observed that Gradient Boosting Classifier model resulted in highest performance with f1-score and accuracy score of 96%.

This project also focuses on BMI (body-mass-index) prediction and different regression models are applied to handle this task (in particular, Suppor Vector Regressor, and Random Forest Regressor. 

The data was obtained from the Kaggle website.
